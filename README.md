***Dashboard building process***

I began this dashboard with utilizing plotly dash to create the various graphs/maps shown on the url above. I then ensured that the grpahs would be able to have clear UI components that would allow users to be able to easily interact with the graphs and correlating dash widgets. In order to create a cohesive design, I used the dash bootstrap components to use the MINTY template. This created a dash app that had the same color themes and font sytles throughout each of the four tabs. Utilizing dash bootstrap components was a new concept to me when building this dashboard, which was not too hard to use as it is very similar to using the dash core components. 

I think that this dashboard is fairly simple, therefore easy to navigate for any users. I also think that this dashboard will have very relevant value for my employment, as my job consists of facility sustainbility practices and reporting out facilities' emissions, etc. That was also one of the main reasons why I thought it would be a good idea to use this dataset for this dashboard.
